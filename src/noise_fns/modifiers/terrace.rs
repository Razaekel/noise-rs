/// Noise function that maps the output value from the source function onto a

/// This noise function maps the output value from the source function onto a
/// terrace-forming curve. The start of the curve has a slode of zero; it's
/// slope then smoothly increases. This curve also contains _control points_
/// which resets the slope to zero at that point, producing a "terracing"
/// effect.
///
/// To add control points to the curve, use the `add_control_point` method.
///
/// An application must add a minimum of two control points to the curve. If
/// there are less than two control points, the get() method panics. The
/// control points can have any value, although no two control points can
/// have the same value. There is no limit to the number of control points
/// that can be added to the curve.
///
/// The noise function clamps the output value from the source function if that
/// value is less than the value of the lowest control point or greater than
/// the value of the highest control point.
///
/// This noise function is often used to generate terrain features such as the
/// stereotypical desert canyon.
