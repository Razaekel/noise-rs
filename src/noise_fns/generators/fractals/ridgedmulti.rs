/// the same way as fBm noise, except the output of each octave is modified by
/// an absolute-value function. Modifying the octave values in this way
/// produces ridge-like formations.
///
/// The values output from this function will usually range from -1.0 to 1.0 with
/// default values for the parameters, but there are no guarantees that all
/// output values will exist within this range. If the parameters are modified
/// from their defaults, then the output will need to be scaled to remain in
/// the [-1,1] range.

/// Ridged-multifractal noise is often used to generate craggy mountainous
/// terrain or marble-like textures.
